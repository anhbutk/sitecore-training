On 2016-10-21, there'as an open book, online exam. Multiple choice. 28 questions out of 40 need to be correct to pass
the exam. There'll also be a certificate if passed.

We'll get the slides on Thursday, October 20, 2016. They may be used during the exam.

*Sitecore Experience Platform is commonly abbreviated as Sitecore XP.*

# Overview

* Sublayout -> Contains path to ASP.NET Web Forms User Control (`*.ascx`)
* (?) Rendering -> Contains path to ASP.NET MVC View (`*.cshtml`)
* Controller Rendering -> Specifies a **Controller** name (fully qualified type name is supported - 
  specifying the assembly name as well), and a **Controller Action** name. It also contains a **Placeholder**
  data field.

* Beware: Sublayouts also have a **Placeholder** Data field. Don't confuse this with the placeholder used on the
  layout.

# Sitecore Modules
